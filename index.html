            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently attending Brigham Young University and studying Information Systems. I relish a fascinating podcast, interesting conversation, and an unassuming win (especially in table tennis). Jerry Seinfeld always makes me laugh. Skateboarding, surfing, fishing, mountain biking, and climbing light my fire. I am a big fan of yardwork. And love of family sustains me.</p>
