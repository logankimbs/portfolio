A [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) app that displays my resume, projects, and contact information.

## Available Scripts

In the app directory, you can run:

### Start Development Server

#### `npm start`

-   This runs the app in development mode.
-   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

### Start Test Runner

#### `npm test`

-   This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Build for Production

#### `npm run build`

-   This creates a build directory with a production build of your app.
-   It properly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
-   The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
